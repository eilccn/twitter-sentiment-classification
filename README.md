## Description
The rise of social media and the recent couple of years of covid-19 lockdown has led to a concerning increase in cyberbullying cases. In 2020, UNICEF even issued a warning in response to the increased cyberbullying compounded by social distancing and increased screen-time. 

Those who bully others on the internet have the convenience of being able to hide anonymously behind a screen, but the people who are bullied are likely to develop mental-health issues that persist even after the bullying has ceased. Due to social mediaâ€™s ability to spread information quickly and anonymously, a single person can easily end up being targeted by a large number of people of various demographics. 

We aim to create a model that will flag harmful tweets and, therefore, protect targets of cyberbullying.

## Dataset
We will be using a kaggle dataset, Cyberbullying Classification, consisting of more than 47,000 tweets labeled according to 6 classes of cyberbullying: Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Religion, Other type of cyberbullying, and Not cyberbullying. Each row of the dataset will have a tweet and its class of cyberbullying. The dataset is meant to be used to create a multi-classification model to predict cyberbullying type, create a binary classification model to flag potentially harmful tweets, and examine words and patterns associated with each type of cyberbullying.
